/*  TASK 4

a.  Formally describe the regular grammar of the lexemes in task 2.

    Using the notation from CTMCP 2.1
    <operator> ::= + | - | * | /
    <command>  ::= p | d | i | ^
    <number>   ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9      
    or, assuming it would support floats 
    <number>   ::= [0...9]* | [0...9]*.[0...9]


b. Describe the grammar of the infix notation in task 3 using (E)BNF. Beware of operator precedence. Is the grammar ambiguous? Explain why it is or is not ambiguous?

I will be reusing <operator> <command> and <number> from task 4a.

<expression> ::= (<expression> | <number>) <operator> ( <expression> | <number> ) ) | ( ( <expression> | <number> ) <command>) 

I think this grammar is unambigious, given that there is a pretty hefty restriction on what can constitute an expression - there is no room for ambiguity here, so to speak.
The first "half" indicates that the expression constitutes a combo of a pair of two numbers and/or expressions, while the second adds another rule to accomodate the i and ^.


c. What is the difference between a context-sensitive and a context-free grammar?

    The grammars described in task a and b are context-free - the expansion of any non-terminal (operator, command, number) will always be the same.
    Context-sensitive grammar adds conditionalities to a context-free one. 
    Thus they become context sensitive, meaning that in addition to rules defined by context-free grammar we also need into account the context in which a particular instance of the language is implemented.


d. You may have gotten float-int errors in task 2. If you havenâ€™t, try running1+1.0. Why does this happen?Why is this a useful error?

    Int and Float are two different types - e.g. their representation is different and thus they might have different operations that one is permitted to use overe them.
    This way we can diferentiate between the two when either is undersired.
